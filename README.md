# Genius Game

This is my first hardware project, I followed the Arduino course from Alura: https://www.alura.com.br/curso-online-arduino.

The code is in Portuguese, my mother language so I'm sorry for you that don't speak Portuguese, you should.. great language. I'm kidding, I will be eventually updating the source code in English.

Later on I will be sharing what I've learned but here is a preview:
* How Light-Emitting Diode (LED) works
* Ohm's law
* Pull-Up
* Analog and Digital input
* How to generate random numbers in Arduino
* and more super fun things...
